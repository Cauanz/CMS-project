## CMS BLOG PROJECT

### Description

This project is a CMS blog project that allows users to create, read, update and delete blog posts. It also allows users to register and login to the site. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JS, NODEJS, EXPRESS, POSTGRESQL ETC...

I'm building this the old way, no frontend frameworks, just plain HTML, CSS and JS. I'm also using the MVC pattern to structure the project.
